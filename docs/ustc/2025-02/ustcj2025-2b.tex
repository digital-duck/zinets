\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This paper presents a novel approach to Chinese characters through the
lens of physics, network analysis, and natural systems. Computational
analysis of over 6,000 characters identified 422 elemental characters
(元字) as fundamental building blocks. Using a physics-inspired
``Zi-Matrix'' model, we analyzed character structure across eleven
spatial positions, revealing systematic patterns in component
relationships and semantic extension.

Our research demonstrates that Chinese characters exhibit properties of
natural systems: emergent complexity, self-organization, and adaptive
resilience. The Fibonacci sequence provides an organizing framework for
understanding character evolution, from simple pictographs to
sophisticated abstractions. Case studies of character families and
semantic networks show how meaning radiates from concrete to abstract
domains while maintaining coherent principles.

By viewing Chinese characters as a living system, this research
transcends mere simplification to reveal how human cognition organizes
and transmits knowledge. While the elemental character set reduces
memorization burden, it also illuminates profound connections between
language, thought, and natural patterns. Chinese characters emerge not
just as tools for communication, but as windows into human
understanding. This perspective, combined with AI-assisted learning
approaches, promises to transform language education from knowledge
mastery to meaning discovery, bridging traditional wisdom with modern
computational methods.

\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}

Learning 汉字 (Hànzì) and, by extension, the Chinese language presents a
unique and substantial challenge for learners, particularly those whose
native languages utilize alphabetic systems. The difficulty stems
primarily from the logographic nature of 汉字, where each character
represents a morpheme (or word) rather than a sound. Unlike phonetic
scripts, there's often no readily apparent connection between a
character's visual form and its pronunciation, demanding rote
memorization of thousands of distinct characters to achieve basic
literacy. This is compounded by the tonal nature of Mandarin Chinese,
where changes in pitch can drastically alter the meaning of a word,
adding another layer of complexity. Furthermore, the sheer volume of
characters, the subtle nuances in stroke order and character
composition, and the existence of both traditional and simplified forms,
require a sustained and dedicated learning effort over a prolonged
period, making the acquisition of fluency in written and spoken Chinese
a significantly time-intensive undertaking compared to many other
languages.

Inspired by the success of reductionism in science, such as the
discovery of fundamental particles in physics and the organization of
the periodic table in chemistry, this research seeks to apply similar
principles to the learning of 汉字. This involves three key approaches:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Network Analysis}: Leveraging computer science and network
  analysis techniques, this study aims to uncover the hidden
  relationships and underlying structures within the large collection of
  Chinese characters. By mapping these connections, the research hopes
  to reveal patterns and simplify the seemingly chaotic complexity of
  the character system.
\item
  \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assistance}: Recognizing the
  burden of rote memorization in traditional 汉字 learning, this
  research explores the use of AI to alleviate this challenge. The goal
  is to develop AI-powered tools that can assist learners in memorizing
  the form, pronunciation, and meaning of characters, as well as their
  complex interactions and contextual usage.
\item
  \textbf{Improve learning and learning expeirence}: The overarching
  research goal, built upon by applying network analysis and AI
  asisstance, is to reduce the learning burdens for students and enrich
  their learning experiences.
\end{itemize}

By combining these computational and AI-driven approaches with a
reductionist perspective, the research aims to provide a novel
exploration into understanding and learning 汉字, ultimately making the
process more efficient, intuitive, and enjoyable for learners.

\subsection{Computational Network Analysis on Chinese
Characters}\label{computational-network-analysis-on-chinese-characters}

The foundational work Shuowen Jiezi (《说文解字》), compiled by Xu Shen
(许慎) during the Eastern Han Dynasty, represents the first systematic
attempt to analyze the structure and etymology of Chinese characters
{[}1, 2, 3{]}. Xu Shen identified 540 radicals (部首, bùshǒu) and used
his ``six scripts'' (六书, liùshū) theory to explain character
formation, categorizing characters based on their composition:
pictographs (象形), ideographs (指事), compound ideographs (会意),
phono-semantic compounds (形声), and two less-common categories (转注
and 假借). While groundbreaking, the Shuowen Jiezi's analysis, focused
on the Small Seal Script (小篆), doesn't perfectly reflect the modern
forms of many characters, and its 540 radicals, while valuable, do not
always represent the smallest, irreducible components.

The later Zihui dictionary and the Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典) refined
and reduced this system, ultimately settling on the 214 Kangxi radicals
{[}4{]}, which serve as a standard indexing system. These radicals,
based primarily on shared visual components, often relating to meaning
(semantic radicals, or 形旁, xíngpáng), provide a method for dictionary
lookups. While many radicals also hint at pronunciation (phonetic
radicals, or 声旁, shēngpáng), this is not always reliable. The Kangxi
system, though widely used, has limitations: ambiguous categorization,
inconsistent semantic and phonetic roles, and some radicals that, due to
their complexity or low frequency of occurrence, are not always the most
informative units for understanding character structure.

Building upon the legacy of Xu Shen and Kangxi systems, the author has
developed a web application called ``ZiNets''. With this tool and
computational network structure, we decomposed 6190 chinese characters
{[}5{]} (including 3910 HSK common characters {[}6{]}). Elemental
characters were identified as those components appearing with a
frequency above a defined threshold.

To systematically analyze the structure of Chinese characters, we
introduce a novel spatial decomposition model, the ``Zi-Matrix.'' This
model represents each character as a matrix of up to eleven distinct
positional components. These positions are defined as: Top (上), Bottom
(下), Left (左), Right (右), Center (中), Top-Left (左上), Top-Right
(右上), Bottom-Left (左下), Bottom-Right (右下), Center-Inside (中内),
and Center-Outside (中外). Each position within the matrix can be either
occupied by a specific character component (a radical, a stroke, or a
more complex sub-component) or remain empty. This 11-component matrix
allows for a consistent and structured representation of the spatial
relationships between the constituent parts of any Chinese character,
regardless of its complexity.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/zi-matrix.png}
\caption{Schematic representation of the Zi-Matrix spatial decomposition
model for Chinese character network analysis.}
\end{figure}

The decomposition of each character into the Zi-Matrix is performed
manually using a hierarchical approach. This process involves a series
of decomposition steps. First, the character is broken down into its
major components, assigning each to its appropriate position within the
matrix. If a component itself is complex, it is further decomposed,
recursively, into its constituent parts, again assigning them to
positions within a sub-matrix representing that component. This
hierarchical decomposition continues until the most fundamental
components -- those that cannot be reasonably further divided -- are
identified. These fundamental components become candidates for the
``elemental character'' set. This manual, hierarchical approach ensures
a consistent and considered analysis of character structure, leveraging
expert linguistic knowledge to guide the decomposition.

\caption{The diagram of hierarchical decomposition tree illustrates the
progressive breakdown of the character into its constituent components,
reading from left to right. This visualization demonstrates the
multi-level structural composition typical of complex Chinese
characters.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Elemental Characters
Analysis}\label{elemental-characters-analysis}

Through manual decomposition of 6190 Chinese characters using the
Zi-Matrix method, we identified 422 unique, irreducible components as
``elemental characters'' (元字). These components represent the
fundamental building blocks that emerged during our hierarchical
decomposition process. Table 1 presents these elemental characters
organized by stroke count, with a clear distinction between traditional
Kangxi radicals and newly identified components.

The identified elemental character set comprises 245 components derived
from the traditional Kangxi radicals system and introduces 177
additional components. This expansion reflects our more granular
approach to character decomposition, where some traditionally grouped
radicals are treated as individual elements. These newly identified
components, though not traditionally recognized as independent units in
standard dictionaries, serve crucial phonetic and/or semantic roles in
character formation. For instance, components like 禺 and 乍, while not
classified as radicals in traditional systems, demonstrate consistent
semantic contributions in compound characters, as we will explore in our
case studies (Section {[}Section Number{]}).

Our elemental character set reveals a finer granularity in Chinese
character composition than the traditional Kangxi system. It encompasses
three main types of components: familiar semantic radicals (e.g.,
氵{[}water{]}, 木{[}wood{]}, 日{[}sun{]}, 月{[}moon{]}, 心{[}heart{]},
手{[}hand{]}, 口{[}mouth{]}), basic structural elements (e.g., 一, 丨,
丿, 丶, 乙, 口, 凵, 冂), and frequently occurring components that carry
both phonetic and semantic information (e.g., 方, 占, 且, 戋, 乍, 禺,
尧, 佥). Some components inherited from the Kangxi system, such as
鼓(drum), while historically significant, may be reconsidered for
practical modern applications. This comprehensive set of elemental
characters provides a more nuanced foundation for understanding and
teaching Chinese character composition, potentially simplifying the
learning process while maintaining semantic integrity.

\subsubsection{Elemental Characters: Occurrence Frequency and
Categorization}\label{elemental-characters-occurrence-frequency-and-categorization}

Analysis of high-frequency elemental characters (with occurrences above
23, a threshold chosen to include 气 {[}qi/breath/energy{]}, given its
fundamental importance in Chinese philosophy and culture) reveals clear
patterns in character composition. The frequency distribution shows
strong clustering around fundamental human concepts and natural
elements. For instance, in human-related categories (人-), elements like
口 (mouth, 300 occurrences) and 手 (hand, 261 occurrences) show
remarkably high usage rates, reflecting their importance in expressing
human actions and experiences. Similarly, in the natural world
categories, 水 (water, 377 occurrences) and 木 (wood, 324 occurrences)
demonstrate high frequencies, indicating their crucial role in character
formation related to natural phenomena. Notably, 亻(human radical, 213
occurrences) and 女 (female, 137 occurrences) also show high
frequencies, underlining the human-centric nature of character
formation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/top-elemental-zi-ENU.png}
\caption{Frequency distribution and categorization of top elemental
characters with occurrences above 23.}
\end{figure}

The categorization system reveals a hierarchical organization centered
on major conceptual domains. The system distinguishes between
human-centered categories (人-系列) including physiological (生理),
psychological (心理), and behavioral (行) aspects; natural elements
(天文-) including the traditional five elements (金木水火土); and
categories for flora (植物-), fauna (动物-), mathematical concepts
(数理-), and abstract concepts (概念-). This classification not only
reflects traditional Chinese philosophical understanding of the world
but also provides a systematic framework for understanding character
composition. Notably, the frequency distribution within these categories
suggests that characters related to human experience and basic natural
elements form the core building blocks of the writing system, while more
specialized or abstract concepts show lower frequencies. The inclusion
of 气 (24 occurrences) in this analysis proves particularly significant,
as it represents a threshold case that bridges fundamental philosophical
concepts with practical character formation patterns.

\subsubsection{Visualizing
Categorization}\label{visualizing-categorization}

The visualization reveals a remarkable pattern in the distribution of
Chinese characters that reflects ancient Chinese cosmological
understanding. Beginning with celestial elements (天文-), the categories
flow through natural phenomena to human experience, creating a narrative
that resonates deeply with traditional Chinese philosophical principles.
The striking prominence of human-related physiological characters
(人-生理, 1106 occurrences) at the center of this distribution, bridged
between natural elements and social constructs, echoes the classical
Chinese view of humans as the connecting point between Heaven and Earth
(天人合一). This central position is flanked by substantial
representations in both natural domains---flora (植物-, 558 occurrences)
and fauna (动物-, 466 occurrences)---and social spheres (社会-, 815
occurrences).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/zi_category_histogram.png}
\caption{Distribution of elemental characters across conceptual
categories, showing frequency of occurrence ordered from cosmic to human
to abstract realms.}
\end{figure}

Within the astronomical/natural elements category (天文-), water (水,
406 occurrences) and wood (木, 324 occurrences) show notably higher
frequencies than fire (火), metal (金), and earth (土), suggesting their
greater significance in character formation. The systematic progression
from celestial phenomena through natural elements, human experience, and
finally to abstract mathematical concepts (数理-) reveals an elegant
hierarchical structure that mirrors traditional Chinese cosmological
ordering. This distribution pattern suggests an underlying
organizational principle in Chinese character evolution that reflects
both human cognitive development and natural world observations, a
relationship that will be further explored through its connection to the
Fibonacci sequence.

\subsubsection{Character Compositional
Patterns}\label{character-compositional-patterns}

Analysis of character compositions reveals patterns remarkably similar
to molecular organization in nature. Just as atoms combine through
fundamental interactions, elemental characters (元字) interact spatially
to form more complex characters. The most prevalent arrangements mirror
basic two-body interactions, appearing as phonetic-semantic compounds in
various orientations: left-middle (L-M, 3,033 characters), up-down (U-D,
727 characters), up-middle (U-M, 688 characters), and left-right (L-R,
534 characters). These relative positions, while described in modern
directional terms, reflect more fundamental spatial relationships that
transcend the historical evolution from vertical to horizontal writing
systems.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/app_compositional_pattern.png}
\caption{Distribution of elemental character compositional patterns,
showing frequency of each pattern type.}
\end{figure}

More complex patterns demonstrate sophisticated geometric arrangements
analogous to multi-body interactions in physics. Three-component
interactions manifest in triangular configurations like
down-left\_up-right\_up (D-LU-RU, 45 characters) and
left\_up-left\_down-right (LU-LD-R, 28 characters), while four-component
interactions appear in symmetrical enclosure patterns, though less
frequently (6 characters). This three-dimensional spatial organization
distinguishes Chinese characters from the linear sequence of alphabetic
writing systems, reflecting instead the multi-dimensional interactions
observed in natural systems. The clear preference for simpler two-body
arrangements, followed by decreasing frequency of more complex geometric
patterns, mirrors nature's tendency toward efficient, stable
configurations. This distribution provides valuable insights for both
understanding character formation principles and developing effective
learning strategies based on fundamental spatial relationships.

\subsection{Storytelling Characters}\label{storytelling-characters}

Chinese characters are not merely symbols for recording language; they
are sophisticated vehicles for storytelling that encode observations,
wisdom, and natural principles within their structure. Building upon our
analysis of elemental characters and their compositional patterns, we
now explore how these basic units combine to tell stories at multiple
scales - from individual character families to complete poems. Just as
molecules tell the story of matter's organization through their bonds
and interactions, Chinese characters reveal deeper narratives through
their semantic relationships and evolving combinations. This section
examines how meaning emerges through increasingly complex arrangements:
from character families that share common elements, through network-like
compound formations, to the crystalline structures of classical poetry.
Each level demonstrates how Chinese writing, like natural systems,
achieves remarkable efficiency in encoding information while maintaining
profound aesthetic and philosophical coherence.

\subsubsection{3.1 Case Studies - Composite
Characters}\label{case-studies---composite-characters}

\paragraph{3.1.1 The 日 Family}\label{the-ux65e5-family}

The Chinese character ``日'' (rì), meaning ``sun'' or ``day'', serves as
a powerful illustration of how Chinese characters efficiently encode
natural observations and knowledge. The character's evolution from its
oracle bone pictograph---depicting a circular sun with a central
dot---to its modern form demonstrates remarkable preservation of core
visual concepts while gaining calligraphic efficiency.

The character 春 (spring) exemplifies efficient semantic encoding
through its components: 三 (representing multiple aspects - abundance of
sprouting life, layers of frozen earth), 八 (break/split), and 日 (sun).
Together, these elements capture the dynamics of spring's arrival - the
interaction between strengthening sunlight, earth's layers, and emerging
life. This structure demonstrates how Chinese characters can layer
multiple related meanings within a single, coherent form.

\paragraph{3.1.2 The 坙 Family}\label{the-ux5759-family}

The character 坙 exemplifies how Chinese writing preserves fundamental
principles of human innovation. Beyond its basic meaning of ``core'' and
``lightness,'' this character documents a critical transition in human
understanding: the discovery that effectiveness comes from optimized
structure rather than raw mass. The progression from solid stone wheels
to spoked wooden designs represents both technological advancement and
conceptual breakthrough - the recognition that core principles often
emerge through reduction rather than addition.

derivative character extends the core concept of structural efficiency
into different domains, from atomic physics (氢) to biological systems
(茎), preserving not just the end results but the underlying principles
of innovation.

\paragraph{3.1.3 The 禺 Family}\label{the-ux79ba-family}

fundamental concept of coupling.

\paragraph{3.1.4 The 乍 Family}\label{the-ux4e4d-family}

The character 乍 represents fundamental concepts of work, creation, and
transformation. Its historical forms suggest the process of making or
transforming materials, functioning as a semantic force carrier for
various types of productive activity.

social domains - much like how energy manifests in different forms
throughout nature.

\paragraph{3.1.5 The 寺 Family}\label{the-ux5bfa-family}

The character 寺, originally depicting a temple or place of authority,
functions as a semantic carrier representing ordered structure and
measured interaction. Its architectural origins in temple design suggest
principles of balance, hierarchy, and measured sacred space.

\subsubsection{3.2 Case Studies - Pinyin - A
Counter-Argument}\label{case-studies---pinyin---a-counter-argument}

In the Chinese language, sound (声 shēng), form (形 xíng), and meaning
(意 yì) are all integral components of a vibrant, living system.
Over-emphasizing any single aspect at the expense of the others would be
inefficient, misguided, and unwise. While the Pinyin romanization system
has undeniably augmented the Chinese language by integrating Latin
phonetic components, relying solely on Pinyin and abandoning Chinese
characters would result in a tremendous loss of semantic meaning and
cultural wisdom. The limitations of a purely phonetic system become
apparent below using cases of homophony:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Single-character homophony:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mā: 妈 (mother), 蚂 (ant), 马 (mǎ, horse), 骂 (mà, yell or curse)
  \item
    shì: 是 (to be), 事 (matter), 市 (market), 式 (style), 世 (world)
  \item
    yì: 意 (meaning), 义 (righteousness), 艺 (art), 易 (change)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Compound-word disambiguation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``xiansheng'' in Pinyin could represent:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      先生 (teacher/mister)
    \item
      献身 (sacrifice oneself)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Chinese characters, in their elegance and complexity, encode both visual
and auditory information while preserving crucial semantic distinctions.
This harmonious integration of form and function has sustained the
language for millennia. The path forward lies in preserving this
sophisticated writing system while thoughtfully incorporating modern
tools like Pinyin as complementary aids rather than replacements.

\subsubsection{3.3 Case Studies - Characters and
Phrases}\label{case-studies---characters-and-phrases}

Just as matter organizes itself into increasingly complex structures -
from atoms to molecules to molecular clusters - language exhibits
similar emergent properties at different scales. Individual characters
(字) serve as the atomic units, carrying fundamental meanings and
combining properties. These form compounds and phrases (词组), analogous
to molecules with stable semantic bonds. At a higher level of
organization, these linguistic molecules arrange themselves into
sophisticated structures like poems, which, like molecular clusters,
exhibit properties beyond the sum of their parts. This natural hierarchy
of meaning-making demonstrates the living, self-organizing nature of
Chinese language.

\caption{Semantic extensions of 子 across various domains {[}12{]}.}
\end{figure}

This analysis reveals how 子 extends from its concrete meaning of
``child'' into an extraordinarily rich semantic network spanning
natural, social, and abstract domains. At the foundational level, it
captures core human relationships (父子, 子女) and biological growth
(种子, 子宫). Its semantic scope then expands remarkably to encompass
everything from the cosmic scale of fundamental particles (量子, 原子)
to the precision of mathematical abstractions (因子, 子集). The
character's versatility is further demonstrated in its application to
everyday objects (筷子, 房子), temporal concepts (日子, 甲子), and even
cultural-historical contexts (日本鬼子). What's particularly striking is
how 子 maintains its core associations with growth, fundamentality, and
belonging across these diverse domains - whether describing a physical
descendant (孙子), an intellectual lineage (弟子), or the smallest units
of matter (原子). This semantic radiation from concrete to abstract
meanings, while preserving core conceptual links, exemplifies the
sophisticated metaphorical thinking embedded in Chinese character
evolution and compound formation.

understanding. Like well-designed temples, they transform simple
elements into spaces of deep meaning, achieving maximum impact on
culture and civilization.

\subsection{Natural Evolution of
Characters}\label{natural-evolution-of-characters}

In our earlier sections on ``Visualizing Categorization'' and
``Character Compositional Patterns'', we observed how elemental
characters reflect human cognition about nature, how elemental
characters interact like simple objects in the physical world. Here we
explore how Chinese characters may have evolved naturally.

\subsubsection{Historical Context}\label{historical-context}

According to legend, Cangjie invented Chinese characters. Cangjie was a
historian to the Yellow Emperor of China in the 27th century BCE. -
Cangjie was inspired by the natural world, including animal tracks,
landscapes, and the stars. - He believed that if he could capture the
unique features of everything in a single painting, he could create a
writing system. - Cangjie was frustrated with the limitations of
knotting, which was the previous method of recording information. As a
milestone event, Cangjie undoubtedly contributed to the creation of
Chinese writing system. In the grand scheme of a human language, Chinese
characters may have evolved naturally, generation after generation.

\subsubsection{Natural Growth Patterns in Character
Evolution}\label{natural-growth-patterns-in-character-evolution}

Just as natural systems evolve from simple to complex through
predictable patterns, Chinese characters demonstrate similar organic
development. The Fibonacci sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,\ldots)
provides an elegant framework for understanding this evolution, not as a
rigid mathematical correspondence, but as a metaphor for how complexity
emerges from simplicity in systematic ways.

The accompanying images of Fibonacci patterns in nature - from sunflower
seed arrangements to nautilus shells, from fern fronds to spiral
galaxies - reveal this universal principle of growth and organization.
This same principle can illuminate our understanding of how Chinese
characters evolved from Cangjie's initial inspiration to their current
form.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/fibonacci-spiral-2.png}
\caption{Natural manifestations of the Fibonacci spiral. The composite
shows nine examples of spiral patterns found in nature and mathematics:
(top row) a sunflower seed arrangement with overlaid golden spiral, a
geometric spiral pattern, and a succulent plant's leaf arrangement;
(middle row) a garden snail shell displaying logarithmic spiral
patterning, the Fibonacci rectangle construction showing the sequence
21:13:8:5, and a cross-section of a nautilus shell; (bottom row) an
unfurling fern frond (fiddlehead), a satellite image of a tropical
cyclone, and a spiral galaxy. These diverse examples demonstrate how the
Fibonacci sequence and associated spiral patterns appear repeatedly
across different scales in natural phenomena, from botanical growth
patterns to astronomical structures.}
\end{figure}

Inspired by universal natural growth pattern like Fibonacci sequence,
this author borrows the sequence to organize Chinese characters in a
similar natural progression: from simple pictographs to sophisticated
composite characters, from concrete objects to abstract concepts. This
natural progression is not just an organizational framework - it
reflects how human cognition itself evolved from basic perceptions to
complex abstractions. Just as the Fibonacci spiral demonstrates how
complex natural patterns emerge from simple mathematical relationships,
our organization reveals how Chinese writing evolved from basic elements
(元字) into increasingly complex expressions. Each level introduces new
fundamental characters that, like the expanding spiral, serve as
building blocks for richer linguistic representations. This approach
mirrors nature's own efficiency in developing complex systems from
simple foundations.

\subsubsection{Elemental Character (元字)
Levels}\label{elemental-character-ux5143ux5b57-levels}

In the following, we list the 元字 collection from first 9 levels
Traditional radicals with independent meaning are noted under ``Radical
form mapping'' (e.g.~灬 means fire).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 (一): 气 (primordial force/energy)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The most fundamental 元字
  \item
    Represents the emergence of invisible form from formlessness
    (无中生有)
  \item
    Base unit for energy and force concepts
  \item
    炁 is an uncommon and old form for 气, rarely used. But its lower
    radical (灬) hints its semantic meaning related to fire and energy.
  \item
    Radical form mapping: 气 is a radical, all characters containing 气
    are related to fundamental nuclear and chemical elements or matter
    in gaseous form, e.g., 氢 (hydrogen gas), 氦 (Hellium), 氧 (oxygen),
    汽 (vapor), 氛 (atmosphere)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  1 (一): 点，线 (primitive low-dimensional object)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Basic radicals 元字: 丶(dot), 一 (horizontal line), 丨 (vertical
    line), 丿 (north-east line), 乀 (south-east line)
  \item
    Represents visible simple form (i.e., point- or line-like objects),
    although carrying no indenpendent semantic meaning, they derive
    meaning together with other composing character part. As an example,
    we build upon the first elemental character 气,

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      气 + 丿 = 氕 is Protium, the most common and stable isotope of
      hydrogen with one proton (i.e., 1 nucleon);
    \item
      气 + 刂 = 氘 is Deuterium, stable and 0.02\% of naturally
      occurring hydrogen, with one proton and one neutron (i.e., 2
      nucleons);
    \item
      气 + 川 = 氚 is Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, with
      one proton and two neutrons (i.e., 3 nucleons). Here, 丿, 刂, 川
      indicate 1,2,3 nucleons in the respective hydrogen isotopes.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  2 (二): 日,月 (sun and moon)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    First pair of naturally contrasting 元字
  \item
    Represents 2 visible solar objects and a fundamental abstraction in
    the basic dualism philosophy (阴阳)
  \item
    Foundation for temporal and luminance concepts
  \item
    Both characters can be used as radicals. It is worthwhile to note
    that 月 means body part meat/flesh 肉 when used as radical. This is
    likely a historical coincidence where 月 was adopted as the
    simplified writing form for 肉.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  3 (三): 天,地,人 (heaven, earth, human)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This research demonstrates how simplification and deeper understanding
can work hand in hand in the study of Chinese characters. By identifying
422 elemental characters (元字) through computational network analysis,
we have achieved significant simplification of the learning challenge -
reducing the initial memorization burden from thousands of characters to
a manageable set of foundational elements. However, this simplification
leads not to reduction but to enrichment of understanding in several key
ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  From Memorization to Understanding
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Instead of rote learning of thousands of isolated characters
\item
  Learners grasp systematic patterns of character formation
\item
  Understanding how complex meanings emerge from simple elements
\item
  Recognition of natural organizational principles in language
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  From Static to Dynamic Understanding
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Characters revealed as a living, evolving system
\item
  Clear visualization of how meanings extend from concrete to abstract
\item
  Appreciation of the system's adaptive capacity for new concepts
\item
  Recognition of internal logic in character evolution
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  From Fragmented to Integrated Knowledge
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Connection between language and natural patterns
\item
  Integration of linguistic, philosophical, and scientific insights
\item
  Bridge between traditional wisdom and modern analysis
\item
  Cross-disciplinary understanding of knowledge organization
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  From Surface to Deep Structure
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Beyond simple visual components to semantic networks
\item
  Recognition of sophisticated metaphorical thinking
\item
  Understanding of systematic meaning extension
\item
  Appreciation of cultural and cognitive patterns
\end{itemize}

This deeper understanding enriches learning experiences by: - Making
character learning more intuitive and systematic - Revealing connections
across different knowledge domains - Enabling appreciation of cultural
and philosophical dimensions - Supporting creative engagement with the
writing system

The research demonstrates that true simplification comes not from
reduction alone, but from revealing underlying patterns and principles.
By understanding Chinese characters as a naturally evolved system, we
gain both practical advantages in learning and deeper insights into how
human cognition organizes and transmits knowledge. This approach opens
new possibilities for: - AI-enhanced learning tools based on natural
patterns - Cross-cultural communication of complex concepts -
Integration of traditional wisdom with modern analysis - Development of
more intuitive teaching methods

The success of this analysis suggests that the path from simplification
to deeper understanding is not a trade-off but a synergy, where reduced
complexity reveals deeper patterns and richer meanings. This insight has
implications not only for Chinese language learning but for how we
approach the study of complex systems in general.
