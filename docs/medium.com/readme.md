Prompt:
can you draft a water-down blog for me from attached arxiv.org paper in pdf, I plan to submit it to medium.com

1) write it in a popular tone as an introduction to my e-print, highlight those elemental characters and case studies by removing all the academic stuffs and speculative terms in physics, computer, and linguistics
2) also remove the appendix on ZiNets web app, 

I will revise your draft and go from there,
Thanks
