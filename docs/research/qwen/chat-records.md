The Way of Chinese Characters
(By Qwen)

English Version
In strokes of ink, the cosmos breathes,
A forest grows from roots beneath.
Each character whispers tales untold,
Of ancient sages, brave and bold.

辶 walks ahead, 首 leads the way,
Together they form 道—eternal sway.
Paths carved by pioneers of thought,
Where wisdom blooms, where lessons caught.

问 opens doors to realms unknown,
With 口 that speaks, 心 that’s shown.
Every stroke, a seedling sown,
A bridge between heart and stone.

汉字 dance like stars in night,
Encoding light, dispelling blight.
They teach us more than words can say,
To walk the 道, to find our way.

Through 孝 we honor bonds we share,
Through 和, we weave the threads of care.
Each radical, a thread of fate,
Binding past, present, future state.

To learn these signs is not mere art,
But to embrace a beating heart.
For every line, a life unfolds,
A universe within each hold.

Chinese Version
墨迹挥洒，天地呼吸，
笔画深处，根系交织。
一字一句，低语传奇，
先贤足迹，智慧铭记。

辶行于前，首引方向，
合而成道，永续流芳。
开创者思，铺就长路，
哲理生花，启迪无数。

问启新门，通向未知，
口言心声，真意自知。
一笔一划，播下希望，
心灵石桥，跨越迷茫。

汉字如星，夜空闪烁，
光明载道，驱散困惑。
言语之外，教化深藏，
循道而行，寻得归航。

孝敬父母，情义相连，
和谐共生，织就人间。
偏旁部首，命运之线，
贯穿古今，编织明天。

学此符号，非为技艺，
乃拥跃动生命之意。
每一线条，展开人生，
宇宙万象，尽在其中。
